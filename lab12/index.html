			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>
				I was struggling with remembering how to use jQuery and the different
				methods. Especially how to call on them correctly.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				I had a problem with not being able to get the length. For some reason, it
				would error and not let the console print. So after adding some console
				logs I was able to find out the problem. I was using '.length()' rather
				than '.length' with no parenthesis.

			<h2>Results</h2>
