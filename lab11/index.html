			<h1>Lab 11: Libraries & jQuery</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>
				I was struggling with remembering how to use jQuery and the different
				methods.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				I had a problem with getting the colors to change with every click
				of the button. I soon realized that it could be because within the
				js it's only done once and to do it multiple times it would have to be
				within the function
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				Click the buttons!!! And refresh the page for a new color everytime.
