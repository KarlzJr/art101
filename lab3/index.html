			<p>
				In this lab we were instructed to create an organized file structure for the rest of
				our labs to make is easier to read and locate files.
			</p>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>
				I had some challenges with the css and properly placing the picture to be in the corner.
				After looking at some examples and reading Professor Modes' css I was able to see my mistakes and
				get it to work very well.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>
				After that and adding links you are able to access this lab as well I now have a very nice
				file structure.
