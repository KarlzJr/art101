			<h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>
				The challenge that I had was printing the string the way I wanted it to be.
				It took some fiddling but it looks good now.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				A problem that we had was that it would add to the output everytime that
				the submit button was pressed rather then clearing the output everytime.
				We looked up some JQuery attributes and found the '.empty()' which clears
				the output div.
			</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>
			<input type="number" id="input">
			<button id="button">Submit</button>
			<div id=output> </div>
