		<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-Solving</h1>
		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>
				The challege that we faced was coming up with a game that we could put into a computer
				task. We were thinking super complex games at first but at the end we came to an agreement
				on Blackjack/21 since it was easy to break up and code in the future.
			</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				The problem we had is that we but it into a highlevel break down and not necessarily code speak. We
				were a little confused there and we just indented where we saw was necessary to make sense.
			</p>
		<h2>Result</h2>
