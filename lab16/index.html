			<h1>Lab 16: JSON and APIs (XKCD comic!)</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>
				I had some Challenges trying to get the output to look nice and neat.
				Outside of that there was also the fact I kepy getting erros but I
				forgot to enable the CORS Unlock.
			</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>
				I had a small problem when it came to the numbers. I didn't know where
				to start it from. I decided on doing 500 just becuase, but then I thought
				of doing a random number. So I went back to the documents and checked if
				ther were at least 1,000 comics and I made the random number any where
				from 0-1,000.
